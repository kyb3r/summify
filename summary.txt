In this earnings call, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and CFO Colette Kress discussed the company's progress in adapting to the macro environment, new platforms, and the impact of crypto on the GPU market. They reported that the launch of the A100 GPU and the ADA product line was a success, with GPUs selling out quickly, and the reception of the 4090 and 4080 GPUs being “off the charts.” They also discussed the company’s relationship with cloud service providers (CSPs) and reported that the public cloud side of their business will likely be the majority of their overall consumption. Supply constraints were addressed, with Huang noting that the inventory of secondhand and used GPUs is never zero and Kress noting that the supply of network products was improving. Finally, Kress mentioned that stock-based compensation will continue to be an important part of their employees’ compensation.
